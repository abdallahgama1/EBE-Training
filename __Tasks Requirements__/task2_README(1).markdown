# Calculator Project

## 📋 Overview
This project is a **command-line calculator** **Go programming**. It progresses through three levels—**easy to intermediate**—to build familiarity with Go syntax, fundamental programming concepts, and data structures. Each level introduces new features and Go concepts, ensuring a structured learning path for beginners.

## 🎯 Objective
Develop a command-line calculator that performs mathematical operations, helping trainees master:
- Go syntax (variables, functions, control structures).
- Data structures (slices, structs, maps).
- String parsing and algorithmic thinking.

## 🛠️ Project Levels and Requirements

### Level 1: Easy - Basic Calculator
**Goal**: Familiarize trainees with Go syntax, basic input/output, and simple functions.

**Requirements**:
- Support basic arithmetic operations: **addition (+)**, **subtraction (-)**, **multiplication (*)**, and **division (/)**.
- Accept user input for two numbers (`float64`) and an operator via the command line.
- Display the result of the operation.
- Handle **division by zero** with an error message.
- Provide an option to exit the program.

**Features**:
1. Prompt users to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /).
2. Perform the selected operation and show the result.
3. Display errors for invalid operators or division by zero.
4. Allow users to exit the program.

**Go Concepts Covered**:
- Variables and data types (`float64`, `string`).
- Standard input/output (e.g., `fmt.Scanln` or `bufio.Reader`).
- Functions to modularize operations (e.g., `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`).
- Conditionals (`if-else` or `switch`) for operator selection.
- Basic error handling with return values or `panic` (optional).

### Level 2: Easy-Intermediate - Enhanced Calculator with History
**Goal**: Introduce slices, structs, and menu-driven programming.

**Requirements**:
- Extend the basic calculator to store a **history of calculations**.
- Allow users to view all calculations performed in the session.
- Use a **slice** to store calculation records (e.g., "2 + 3 = 5").
- Provide a menu to select: perform a calculation, view history, clear history, or exit.
- Handle invalid menu inputs gracefully.

**Features**:
1. Store each calculation (numbers, operator, result) in a slice.
2. Display a menu with options: **(1) Calculate**, **(2) View History**, **(3) Clear History**, **(4) Exit**.
3. Show history with formatted output (e.g., index, expression, result).
4. Allow users to clear the history.
5. Handle invalid menu inputs with clear error messages.

**Go Concepts Covered**:
- Slices (`[]string` or custom struct for history).
- Structs to represent calculations (e.g., `struct { num1, num2 float64; op string; result float64 }`).
- Loops (`for`, `range`) to iterate over history.
- String formatting with `fmt.Sprintf` for history display.
- Menu-driven program flow with `switch`.

### Level 3: Intermediate - Advanced Calculator with Expressions
**Goal**: Introduce maps, string parsing, and complex logic for evaluating mathematical expressions.

**Requirements**:
- Allow users to input a full mathematical expression (e.g., "2 + 3 * 4").
- Support **operator precedence** (e.g., * and / before + and -).
- Use a **map** to store operator functions or precedence levels.
- Handle invalid expressions with clear error messages.
- Maintain the history feature from Level 2.

**Features**:
1. Parse a string input (e.g., "2 + 3 * 4") into tokens (numbers and operators).
2. Evaluate expressions respecting operator precedence (e.g., compute 3 * 4 first, then add 2).
3. Store the expression and result in history.
4. Display errors for invalid expressions (e.g., "2 + + 3" or "5 / 0").
5. Allow users to re-run a previous expression from history.

**Go Concepts Covered**:
- Maps (e.g., `map[string]int` for operator precedence or `map[string]func(float64, float64) float64` for operations).
- String parsing (using `strings.Split` or custom tokenization).
- Stack-based expression evaluation (using slices as stacks for numbers and operators).
- Error handling with custom error types.
- Pointers (optional, for advanced history manipulation).

### Level 4: Intermediate
**Goal**: Introduce interface, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Modularity

**Requirements**:
1. Allow users to select a calculator type via a menu at the start of the program.
2. Handle operations specific to each calculator type while maintaining a consistent user interface.
3. Organize code into separate packages to encapsulate each calculator’s logic.
4. Use structs and interfaces to abstract calculator behavior and ensure extensibility.
5. Handle invalid inputs (e.g., unsupported operations for a given calculator type) with clear error messages.

**Features**:
1. Add new Calculator type Scientific .
2. Support Basic Calculator Operations plus square root, power (x^y), factorial.
3. Store the expression and result in history.
4. Display errors for invalid expressions.
5. Allow users to re-run a previous expression from history.

**Go Concepts Covered**:
1. Encapsulation
2. Interfaces
3. Packages

## ℹ️ Additional Notes
- **Code Organization**: Encourage trainees to use separate files for different components (e.g., `operations.go` for calculation logic, `history.go` for history management).
- **Testing**: Introduce unit testing with Go’s `testing` package to verify operations and expression evaluation.
- **Extensions** (for advanced learners):
  - Support parentheses in expressions (requires a more complex parser).
  - Implement persistent history using file I/O (`os` or `io` packages).
  - Add support for additional operations (e.g., modulus, exponentiation).
- **Resources**:
  - [Official Go Tour](https://tour.golang.org) for learning syntax.
  - [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com) for practical code snippets.
  - Practice problems on [Exercism](https://exercism.org) or [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) to reinforce concepts.
